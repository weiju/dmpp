What is Cymus ?
---------------

Cymus is an emulation library for the I/O chip MOS CIA-8520/6526.
The name developed out of the combination "CIA" and "MOS".
Interestingly, this is also the name of a bug - used for a piece
of software, this can only mean luck :-)

I initially wanted to call it "Special Agent MOSo", but I guess
that is a little too silly :-)
